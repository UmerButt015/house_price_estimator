# house_price_estimator

House Price Estimation System:
This project predicts house prices using machine learning models. It processes a dataset of real estate data, cleans and transforms it, trains multiple models (Random Forest and XGBoost), and saves the best-performing model for future use. A Flutter frontend can be connected to allow users to input data and get instant price predictions.

Features:
Cleans and preprocesses house price data
Handles missing values and duplicate entries
Trains two models: Random Forest and XGBoost
Compares models using R² score and RMSE
Saves the best model using joblib
Prepares the dataset for deployment
Easy to connect with a Flutter frontend for real-time predictions

Tech Stack
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, sklearn, xgboost, joblib
Frontend: Flutter (for UI integration )

Models Used
Two regression models are trained and compared:
XGBoost Regressor
Random Forest Regressor

Evaluation Metrics
R² Score: Measures how well predictions match actual values 
RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error): Measures prediction error
